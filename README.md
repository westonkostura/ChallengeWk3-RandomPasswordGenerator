# Random Password Generator

## Description

This project is a random password generator, which first prompts users to enter the number of characters they would like in their password, then a confirmation if they would like special characters as well. The reason for building this project is to build secure and random passwords that the users can then copy and use for their own needs. This project taught me how to utilize javascript and manipulate the DOM on a webpage.


## Usage

Usage for this project includes starting the password generation with the 'generate password' button, then following the prompts for character amount and usage of special characters or not.

## Credits

I used examples from the ASU practice activities, and examples from websites such as Stack OverFlow and the MDN Docs.
